# Jesper's First CS193 Homework

## Some of my Favorite things about CS193
- I really like how informatice the instructors are with the slides
- There is a collaborative feel about the class
- I like how we get to learn fundamental things that relate to our major
- I like how it is not as big as the lecture hall
